## Project Objective
The primary objective is to build a comprehensive dashboard that highlights essential metrics related to credit card usage, such as revenue, transaction counts, customer count, and other critical KPIs. This dashboard offers an efficient way to track weekly performance and assess trends that may impact business decisions.

## Steps Involved:
  ## 1. Data Import from SQL
  <li> Prepare CSV Files: The initial step was to organize the raw data in CSV format. <br>
  <li> Create SQL Tables: SQL tables were created to store the imported data for further processing.  <br>
  <li> Data Import: CSV files were imported into the SQL database to ensure smooth integration with Power BI.  <br>
    
  ### 2. Data Processing & DAX
  <li> Data Cleaning: After importing the data into SQL, it was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and consistency.<br>
  <li> DAX Queries: Utilized DAX queries to create key measures and calculated fields for the dashboard.<br>
